In the video i go over a few thing like:
- setting up a twitter bot
- working with tweepy
- getting notified of tweets
- handeling errors
- sending texts with twillio
- handelling json files
- using crontab
- the bare bones of linode and VPS's in general

this project is by no means perfect but i enjoyed making it and i hope you can learn a little from me along the way. Feel free to suggest changes or shoot me an email at [my email](mailto:joshua.himmens@gmail.com) or even if you want more content
