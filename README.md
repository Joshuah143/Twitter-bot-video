## Getting started:

This is what you need to run for the tweepy package:

    pip install tweepy or smt
    
If you want to also to use twillio:

    pip install tweepy

If you are using the pycharm IDE you won't need to use either, follow the steps shown in the video to import the modules.

## How to go further:
###### These are some ideas for how you could go deeper into this project
- Use dynamic data (e.g. Temp data, garden monitor)
- Have tweepy record tweets sent by your bot to a json file, so you can mass delete just the tweets sent by your bot
- Create your own version of tweepy, the Twitter API is super easy to use and create
- Send the quotes in a daily text or email
- Import this file into other scripts to use functions like sending texts/emails/qoutes
- Do something better than I did it and make your own YouTube video
